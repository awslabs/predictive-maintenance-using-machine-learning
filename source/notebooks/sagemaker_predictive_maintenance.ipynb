    "NASA’s Prognostic Center of Excellence established a repository with datasets to be used for benchmarking prognostics and predictive maintenance related algorithms. Among these datasets involves data from a turbofan engine simulation model C-MAPPS (or Commercial Modular Aero Propulsion System Simulation). The references section contains details about the over 100 publications using this dataset. C-MAPPS is a tool used to generate health, control and engine parameters from a simulated turbofan engine. A custom code wrapper was used to inject synthetic faults and continuous degradation trends into a time series of sensor data. Some high level characteristics of this dataset are as follows:\n",
    "The data obtained is from a high fidelity simulation of a turbofan engine, but closely models the sensor values of an actual engine. Synthetic noise was added to the dataset to replicate real-world scenarios. The effects of faults are masked due to operational conditions, which is a common trait of most real world systems."

Since the example dataset we're using is small we can run the preprocessing code located in `preprocess.py` on this notebook instance. The preprocessing script computes the RUL (Remaining Useful Life) column for each engine data in the training dataset. We also apply min-max scaling to normalize our sensor readings to between 0 and 1 for each column. We read and preprocess the test data as well. It consists of sensor readings and the actual RUL. See the code in `preprocess.py` for more. To adapt this to your own dataset, you would need to implement your custom preprocessing for your dataset. We plot a few columns from the training data for visualization purposes."
